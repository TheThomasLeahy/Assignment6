To do

-Add more test cases in TestTicketOffice.java

Repeat the following for each client in line until show is sold out
Seat <- find the bestAvailableSeat()
If there is an available seat then
markAvailableSeatTaken(Seat)
printTicketSeat(Seat)
Else
Output to the screen �sorry, we are sold out�
End repeat

					Steps of the Program
					
1. Make the server
	1.1 Create the theater object and fill it with seats
	1.2 Why is socket made here?
		1.2.1 ServerSocket vs. socket
	1.3 PORT is assigned when the start() is called
2.  Do we need multiple servers?? or TicketClients??
	2.1 Up to three servers I think
	2.2 Then PORT needs to be a unique number for each itteration


For the server Socket:

public class Server extends Thread  
   {  
       ...  
       void run()  
       {  
           while(Still Tickets availible){
              // serverSocket on "localhost", 1234  
              Socket clientSock = serverSocket.accept();  // accept a new request
              executor.execute(new ClientWorker(clientSock));  
           }
       }  
   }
   
   
   Notes:
   -Use BufferedReader and Buffered Writer to communicate between TicketClient and TicketServer
